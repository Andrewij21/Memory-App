# Memories App

Crafting Memories-App was a blast! With Material UI, Vite, React, and Multer, I cooked up a platform for storing memories. Users can effortlessly upload images with titles and descriptions, spice things up with edits, and sprinkle in some deletion magic. The login and registration features add a dash of user control. Building this playful project not only leveled up my tech skills but also sprinkled some fun into the development journey! ðŸš€âœ¨
